    <h3>Now found exclusively at one well-known pizza garden in Gravesend, Brooklyn, this style of pizza was once found
        in neighborhood bakeries. This pizza is deceivingly light, crisp, and slightly spicy. Enjoy with a can of soda.
    </h3>
    <h4>For making this tasty pizza, you need the following ingredients:</h4>
    <h5>Dough</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cups warm water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>3 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons fine salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Sauce</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can plain crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 can pizza sauce (such as Don Peppino)</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Cheese</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces low-moisture whole-milk mozzarella, very thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 cuo grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1</li>
        <p>Combine water and yeast in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam,
            about 5 minutes.</p>
        <li>Step 2</li>
        <p>Combine flour and salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Pour in
            yeast mixture. Knead dough until smooth, about 7 minutes.</p>
        <li>Step 3</li>
        <p>Grease a large bowl lightly with olive oil. Form dough into a tight ball and lightly grease the top. Place in
            the bowl; cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.</p>
        <li>Step 4</li>
        <p>Mix crushed tomatoes and pizza sauce together in a bowl to make sauce.</p>
        <li>Step 5</li>
        <p>Grease a heavy-gauge rimmed 12x17-inch baking sheet generously with olive oil. Press dough into the bottom.
            Prick dough all over with a fork. Arrange mozzarella cheese slices over dough; cover with 1 cup sauce.
            Sprinkle Pecorino Romano cheese on top. Drizzle remaining olive oil over pizza.</p>
        <li>Step 6</li>
        <p>Let pizza rise in a warm area until puffy, about 1 hour.</p>
        <li>Step 7</li>
        <p>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</p>
        <li>Step 8</li>
        <p>Bake pizza on the center rack of the preheated oven until edges are very dark brown but top is not burnt, 15
            to 20 minutes. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes before slicing into squares.</p>
